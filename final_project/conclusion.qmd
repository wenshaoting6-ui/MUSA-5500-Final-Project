### Key Findings
1.  **Complexity:** Food insecurity in Philadelphia is not merely a geometric problem of distance. It is highly correlated with **vehicle access** and **poverty**.
2.  **The Transportation Gap:** Areas with high "Transportation Barrier" scores (low vehicle ownership) showed significantly higher risk, even when physical distance to a store was moderate.
3.  **Hidden Vulnerability:** Our index identified "Moderate Risk" transition zones that the binary USDA definition often misses. These areas need targeted policy intervention before they degrade into severe food deserts.

### Policy Implications
City planners should focus not just on attracting new supermarkets (which can be difficult), but on:
* **Improving Transit:** Better bus routes connecting "Moderate Risk" neighborhoods to existing grocery hubs.
* **Mobile Markets:** Deploying mobile fresh food markets to high-transport-barrier zones.
* **SNAP Expansion:** Encouraging more local corner stores in high-risk zones to accept SNAP benefits.

### Future Work
Future iterations of this model could incorporate:
* **Food Price Data:** Scraping real-time pricing to measure economic accessibility more precisely.
* **Transit Times:** Using GTFS data to calculate public transit travel times rather than just driving/walking distance.
