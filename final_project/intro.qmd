Access to nutritious and affordable food is a fundamental determinant of public health. In urban environments, "food deserts"—areas with limited access to affordable and nutritious food—disproportionately affect low-income and minority communities.

This project analyzes the food security landscape in Philadelphia, moving beyond simple proximity measures to a comprehensive **Food Desert Index**. 

### The Problem
Traditional definitions of food deserts often rely on binary classifications (e.g., "further than 1 mile"). This project argues that food insecurity is a continuous gradient influenced by:
1.  **Physical Distance:** How far is the store?
2.  **Economic Access:** Can residents afford the food?
3.  **Transportation:** Can residents get to the store?
4.  **Systemic Barriers:** Are there racial or historical disparities?

This portfolio explores these dimensions to identify Philadelphia's most vulnerable neighborhoods.
