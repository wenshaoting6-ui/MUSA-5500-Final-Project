To capture the food access more accurately in Philadelphia, we developed a multi-dimensional Food Desert Index. Specifically, we created a **50-meter resolution grid** analysis. This decision was made to increase the resolution of the results and specifically to account for intra-neighborhood spatial variations, which are often masked by larger census boundaries.

### 1. Spatial Analysis
We created a 50m x 50m vector grid covering the entire city of Philadelphia (approx. 1.5 million cells). We calculate the centroid of each cell for the orign point for network analysis

### 2. Network Analysis
This project used OpenStreetMap street network from osmnx. Specifically, the traveling distances for each cell were calculated to both closest food store and closest USDA-authorized SNAP retailer. 

Then we spatial joined the census data and USDA data into these grids

### 3. The Composite Index
We developed a composite **Food Desert Index (0-100)** where higher scores indicate higher risk. The index is a weighted sum of four components. Due to the study’s aim to employ a comprehensive, multi-perspectival framework for risk identification, we consider these four components to be of equally critical importance in mapping Philadelphia’s food desert risk landscape. A community’s  risk level is the integrated result of the interaction of these four dimensions, and a significant deficiency in ant one dimension is sufficient to place the community at high risk.

$$
\text{Index} = 0.25(\text{Access}) + 0.25(\text{Economic}) + 0.25(\text{Transport}) + 0.25(\text{Demographic})
$$

1. **Physical Accessibility**: Due to observed gap in OSM foodstore data, we weighted more on the SNAP data:  
$$\text{Access} = 0.3(\text{Food Store Dist.}) + 0.7(\text{SNAP Dist.})$$

2. **Economic Vulnerability**: Using ACS 2019-2023 Census data, economic condition was calculated as:
$$\text{Econ} = 0.3(\text{Poverty}) + 0.25(\text{SNAP Rate}) + 0.25(\text{Unemployment}) + 0.2(\text{Inv. Income})$$

3. **Transportation Barriers**: Using both census and USDA Food Atlas data, transportation barrier was calculated as:
$$\text{Trans} = 0.6(\text{HUNV Flag}) + 0.4(\text{Per no Vehicle})
$$Where HUNV Flag indicates tracts with low vehicle access >0.5 miles from a supermarket.

4. **Demographic Disparities**: Using census data, minority groups were calculated as:
$$\text{Min} = \text{Percent Black} + \text{Percent Hispanic}$$

We consider each component equally important for identifying food desert.
