To measure food insecurity accurately, we moved away from census tracts as the smallest unit and utilized a **50-meter resolution grid** analysis.

### 1. Spatial Analysis
We created a 50m x 50m grid covering the entire city of Philadelphia (approx. 1.5 million cells). For every single cell, we calculated:
* **Network Distance:** The walking/driving distance to the nearest supermarket.
* **SNAP Distance:** The network distance to the nearest SNAP-accepting retailer.

### 2. The Composite Index
We developed a composite **Food Desert Index (0-100)** where higher scores indicate higher risk. The index is a weighted sum of four components:

$$
\text{Index} = 0.25(\text{Access}) + 0.25(\text{Economic}) + 0.25(\text{Transport}) + 0.25(\text{Demographic})
$$

| Component | Weight | Indicators |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Physical Accessibility** | 25% | Distance to food stores, Distance to SNAP retailers |
| **Economic Vulnerability** | 25% | Poverty rate, Unemployment rate, Median Household Income, SNAP usage |
| **Transportation Barriers** | 25% | Households without vehicles, Distance combined with lack of car |
| **Demographic Disparities** | 25% | % Minority population (Black + Hispanic) |

We consider each component equally important for identifying food desert.
